        about me.

    <p>
    So. Me..Where to start? Well first I'll start with the meaning behind 'Aubergine'. If you looked up Aubergine before reading this, then great! You basically know what I'm about to say. Aubergine is a color and another name for an eggplant. Aubergine happens to be my favorite color and a name that was given to me by my CIS 215 class. The all-girls school I go to is pretty small and our CS department is comprised of about ~40 or so girls at a given time and my class, class of 2017 happens to be very close. But Aubergine was given to me because instead of calling a "purple" marker purple, I called the marker by it's rightful color, aubergine. Since then, my fellow classmates and professors have referred to me as Aubergine or simply, Auber.
    <br><br>
    Now that Aubergine has been explained, I guess I'll explain myself? Sure I guess let's talk about me! I'm Aubria (oddly close to Aubergine isn't?).I am a Computer Science Major and a wannabe Fine Art minor, the art minor thing comes and goes.
